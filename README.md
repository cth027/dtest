# dtest

This is a small test to check how git and github deal with date tampering, and if the dates
in the repos can be trusted or not. 

This files was created in August 2021 with a local systeml date in August 2020
A push to github appeared impossible due to certificate issues. 
This file was then updated just afterward and commited a second time.
