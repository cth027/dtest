# dtest

This is a small test to check how git and github deal with date tampering, and if the dates
in the repos can be trusted or not. 

This files was created in August 2021 with a local systeml date in August 2020
A push to github appeared impossible due to certificate issues. 
This file was then updated just afterward and commited a second time.  
And it worked, it's the old history in github.  So another forensic mechanism needs to be found.  
Let's check inconsistencies moving back and forth in time
And an anachronism on the same file 

With the anachronisme,  there is a discrepancy between the date of the latest version,  and the date of the latest version according to history.  So tampering in the middle of a project should be detectable.  However start date of the project cannot be trusted.  Unless a trusted timestamp is inserted.
